##Document Template Utility

The goal of the document Template Utility is to take a MS-Word or PDF as a template and fill in data from a JSON document.

The document template utility should be a REACT application. All required libraries must be able to run on the browser.

Examples:
See HelpingHandContactTemplate.docx and HelpingHandContactTemplate.pdf for examples of the input template.

The template contains handle-bar style fields for data to be filled in from the JSON document.

For sample: {{doc.firstname}} should be filled in with “Joe”
